# TrainCartsAddonPayPassengers

Fuck you Liam

This is a super simple plugin/addon for TrainCarts that will pay each passenger of a train a specified amount given a redstone-powered sign. This works for either [train] or [cart] signs

Just add "pay" to the second line, the amount you want to pay each passenger on pass on the third line, then give it redstone power

This plugin requires TrainCarts, BKCommonLib, and any Vault-compatable economy plugin (EssentialsX, for example)
